This project quiz was to help students by giving them tasks to complete. 
Each tasks were base on the week 1 course lessons. Each lessons was fundamental and were focus on building methods.
The idea were to follow the 7 steps process which were used to help complete the tasks. 
I believe that after ulitizing the 7 steps process, my algorithms improved and i was able to complete the task more effeicienty.
